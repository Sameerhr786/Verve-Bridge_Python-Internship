Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

Python (version 3.x recommended)
Required Python libraries:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 selenium pandas
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Sunil-nith/Web_Scraping_Flipkart_Product_Data.git
Navigate to the project directory.
Install the required Python libraries.
First, run web_scraping_1.py, followed by web_scraping_2.py.
Usage
Open the web_scraping_1.py file.
Update the url variable with your desired search query (e.g., bags).
Modify the Pages_to_scrape variable to set the number of pages you wish to scrape (e.g., 20).
Execute the web_scraping_1.py script using Python. This will scrape product data from the specified number of pages and save the basic product information (name, price, URL) to a CSV file named Products_1.csv.
Next, open the web_scraping_2.py file and run the script. This will read the basic product data from Products_1.csv, visit each product URL, extract additional details (e.g., description, FSN, manufacturer), and update the CSV file with this information, saving it as Products_2.csv.
